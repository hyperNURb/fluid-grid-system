# Fluid Grid System

## How to use the Fluid Grid System
To the following code is an example of how the code works. Because The Fluid Grid System is based on a six column grid the only necessary provision is that all of the <div class="three column"> within itâ€™s parent <div class="section"> element add up to 6. A total of 720 different combinations can be achieved in this fashion.

    <code>
    <div class="six_column section">
      <div class="two column">
        <div class="column_content">
          ...
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="three column">
        <div class="column_content">
          ...
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="one column">
        <div class="column_content">
          ...
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    </code>

The code for the Fluid Grid System is simple, lightweight, and non-obtrusive. The following is a sample of an empty three column layout with columns of varying width.
